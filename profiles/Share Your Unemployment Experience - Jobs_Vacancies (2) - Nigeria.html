 lot has really happened to me on this unemployment wahala since i 
finished service last year. I initially got a job as a credit officer in
 a microfinance bank, omooo i won diee for that work cos i didn't know 
it entails me walking around the whole state just to get customers to 
take loan and if i didn't meet stipulated target, my salary might get 
delayed. 2 month into the job, i had already had  to resign cos of the 
hazard the job posed, imagine a young guy like me harassing a 70yr old 
men &amp; women cos of default, it even got to the point I had accident 
 but God saved me shaa, naso i leave the work ooo. 5 months later after 
sapa nearly killed me, i got another job in a Medical Lab working as a 
laboratory officer, i worked there for 6 months and i had to resign this
 month cos the pay was small and my employer wasn't ready to increase 
it, imagine graduate collecting 20K monthly ooo <img src="Share%20Your%20Unemployment%20Experience%20-%20Jobs_Vacancies%20(2)%20-%20Nigeria_files/huh.png" style="width:15px;height:22px;">,
 i enjoyed the job just that the money can't solve anything at all, i 
had to accept the job cos i didn't wanted to sit at home doing nothing 
but the pay was too small...Now I'm currently searching for job, i have a
 BSc in Microbiology and i don't mind working anywhere as far as the pay
 is okay...my Phone number is 07043010958. <img src="Share%20Your%20Unemployment%20Experience%20-%20Jobs_Vacancies%20(2)%20-%20Nigeria_files/smiley.png" alt="smiley" class="faces" border="0"></blockquote>A

 nice of you to be vulnerable enough to share your experience with us 
and give people an opportunity to share theirs too. Fam, being laid off 
after getting used to getting steady income is tragic especially if it 
came at a time when you were not expecting all that.<br><br>We are human
 beings and the first thing is to feel sad and sulk about it. But after 
that, you need to pick your self up and make a decision on what's next. 
It's either time to start looking for another job, or learning a new 
skill that is relevant to your next move, or whatever else.<br><br>The 
most pressing question on the mind of a newly laid off person is where 
will money come from? This can be a scary period, but if you can use it 
well it can be the most life changing period of a person's life.<br><br>Why
 not start a business? you might ask with which money but you can 
literally do dropshipping. Where you make money from selling wholesalers
 products without stocking them. <br><br>There are websites like <a rel="ugc" href="https://www.gotahia.com/">www.gotahia.com</a>
 where you can get access the latest product updates from wholesalers in
 major markets like trade fair, lagos island, mandilas, computer 
village, etc for free. <br><br>With the time you have on your hands and 
the zeal you have to make money, you can channel it to getting customers
 for these products. The thing with starting with Gotahia is that you 
also have access to sales classes which are hosted by sales coaches 
sometimes. <br><br>It's sad to get laid off, but you can definitely  see it as an opportunity to start making money of your own.
